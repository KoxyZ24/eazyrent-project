### The app

For now the app is only capable of get some information from the user and send them to a request bin (https://requestbin.com/r/en0nai8j57zi6j/276ecYb9bfO0PfAejjmZmDWUvjY).

It's fully code in React Native (https://reactnative.dev/) with an extern library:
 - `React navigation`: https://reactnavigation.org/

**For now the information are sent to a public request bin you have to change the url in `Formulaire1` function**
